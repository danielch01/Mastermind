# Mastermind

This is based on a popular board game called "Mastermind" where the "codemaster" 
presets four color codes and the player has to try and guess the answer in twelve tries.
In this version, we have the player choose a set of four numbers from 1 to 6 and they have
to try and guess the computer in twelve tries.

The python file is a scratch file used to get a draft of the code going.

In order to play, use
```ruby
mmind = Mastermind.new()
mmind.play()
```
